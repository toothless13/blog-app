# Blog App

## Overview

The aim of this project was to create a simple blog application, that would allow the user to create, edit, delete and view blog posts.

## Technology

The project was created using a combination of Express, Node.js, and EJS.

## How it works

Templates were used for the header and footer so they could easily remain persistent across different pages.

Data was passed through the various pages using EJS and express, so that the data could be displayed across them e.g. when updating a blog post, the fields would be preloaded with the current data.

## Styling

Bootstrap was used for basic styling, and allowed for the easy creation of a simple, responsive design. This is something I will like to build on in the future.
